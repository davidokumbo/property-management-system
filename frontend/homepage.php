                         large number of tenants. They have enabled us 
                         to focus on other duties that our company 
                         undertakes because all tenant and tenant 
                         financial management has now been fully

                          in good hands. They were meticulous in their 
                          handling of our property. They gave us options
                           and advice, said what they would do and more importantly,
                            they did what they said! It is very early days 
                            in our relationship but if this service continues, 
                            and we are confident it will, we will be very happy indeed.

                        With Bomahut, managing tenants has been made very simple.
                         We no longer have to record payments as they come 
                         in or even invoice tenants every new month. 
                         Rent and utility bills invoicing is automated 
                         as well as the recording of payments. 
                         This has been made possible through 
                         integration of MPESA paybill and all I
                          need to do is log in and Iâ€™ll know who has paid, 
                          who has not and by how much. At this point,
                           I can also send payment reminders which are also
                            done in bulk and everybody who has a balance receives a reminder. 
                            All these features have truly made our work easier.
